== Predeployment steps
. Prior to deploying the Partner Solution, you must agree to the Agree to the https://inductiveautomation.com/ignition/license[Inductive Automation Software License Agreement^].
. If you want to make your Ignition deployment available to the public internet, use `0.0.0.0/0` as value for `WebAccessCIDR` parameter. Otherwise, specify a valid CIDR for who can access Ignition.
. If you are using the *cluster* deployment option, you *must* provide your own domain name to use for the load balancer. The template will use the domain name to generate a trusted Amazon SSL certificate. The template will send the administrator of the domain an email to verify ownership. Make sure to approve the certificate while the CloudFormation stack is being deployed. Upon completion, make sure to set up a CNAME DNS record to the generated ELB domain name from the Outputs tab.
