This Partner Solution provides two ways to deploy Ignition: standalone or cluster.

[[standalone]]
=== Standalone

This option deploys a redundant pair of Ignition servers that are publicly available. Deploying this Partner Solution with default parameters builds the following Ignition environment in the AWS Cloud.

As shown in <<architecture_standalone>>, the standalone deployment option sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** (Optional) Linux bastion hosts in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon EC2 instances and Aurora database in the private subnets.*
** (Optional) An AWS Client VPN configuration to allow direct access to Amazon EC2 instances and Aurora databases in the private subnets (not shown).*
** A primary and secondary Ignition server in the first and second Availability Zones, respectively.
* In the private subnets, an Amazon Aurora DB cluster in a security group containing the following:
*** A primary DB instance supporting write operations.
*** Two replica DB instances supporting read operations.
* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to enable encryption at rest for the Aurora DB cluster.
* Amazon CloudWatch for a bastion host CPU usage alarm.
* Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to send notifications when the CloudWatch alarm is invoked.

[[cluster]]
=== Cluster

The cluster option deploys a redundant pair of Ignition backend (I/O) servers and two frontend servers behind a load balancer. Deploying this Partner Solution with default parameters builds the following Ignition environment in the AWS Cloud.

As shown in <<architecture_cluster>>, the cluster deployment option sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** (Optional) An AWS Client VPN configuration to allow direct access to Amazon EC2 instances and Aurora databases in the private subnets (not shown).*
* In the private subnets:
** A primary and backup Ignition backend server in the first and second Availability Zones, respectively.
** An Ignition frontend server in each Availability Zone.
** An Aurora DB cluster in a security group containing the following:
*** A primary DB instance supporting write operations.
*** Two replica DB instances supporting read operations.
* An Application Load Balancer configured with an Amazon SSL certificate to route traffic to Ignition frontend servers in the private subnets.
* AWS KMS to enable encryption at rest for the Aurora DB cluster.
* CloudWatch for a bastion host CPU usage alarm.
* Amazon SNS to send notifications when the CloudWatch alarm is invoked.
